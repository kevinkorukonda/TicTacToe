Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played between two players on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to form a line of three matching symbols (traditionally 'X' and 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game starts with an empty grid, and players take turns placing their symbols on the board. The first player usually goes with 'X', while the second player uses 'O'. The players continue alternately until one of them achieves a winning combination or the entire grid is filled without a winner, resulting in a tie.

Strategic thinking and foresight are crucial in Tic Tac Toe, as players aim to block their opponent's potential winning moves while simultaneously creating their own winning opportunities. The game is often enjoyed for its simplicity, yet it can still offer challenging and engaging gameplay for players of all ages.
